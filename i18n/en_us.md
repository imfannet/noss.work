*If you have no Social Security, you cannot been set in ICU when you sick.*  -- Inspired by [996.ICU](https://996.icu)
## What happened?
Have you ever noticed some company provide works without provide their recruit SOCIAL SECURITY(A.K.A. Five Insurance and One Fund)?  
Even if the LAW ask the company to do so, the PROFIT cause them challenging the LAW the past, the present, and the future.
Followed by the <Labors' Law of P.R.China>, either the company or the other employer **MUST** provide the SOCIAL SECURITY to their recruit, even if the labor refuse it.
## How is that possible?
Once the company chose to not provide SOCIAL SECURITY, they can save **AT LEAST** 34.3% of labor's salary per recruit, plus with the HOUSING FUND, they **STEAL At Least 39.3%** salary from the labors pockets.
## What are the influences ?
If the company refuse to provide social security to employees, in some area the employees cannot buy a house to establish the family, their children cannot enjoy the rightful education resources, and the employee themselv cannot get the rightful ensurance when they are illed/retired/ out of work or even death.  
Furthermore, the social security and housing fund are the parts of emplpyees rewards of their work, company refuse to provide social securiy will cause the emplyee getting less rewards than normal.
